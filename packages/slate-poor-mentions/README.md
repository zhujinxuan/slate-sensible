## Install

```
yarn add slate-poor-mentions
```

## Simple Usage

```javascript
import MentionsPlugin from "slate-poor-mentions";
const mentions = [{ name: "@ Tom" }, { name: "@ Jerry" }];
export default MentionsPlugin({ mentions } /* options */);
```

## Options

Consider a slate text like

```
 <paragraph> Here is $ To<cursor/>m </paragraph>
```

The plugin options are an object of

- `mentions : Array<{name: string}>` (necessary)

An array of mentions, in each mention object, a name property is necessary as the string for mention replacement.

- `beforeMatchRegex: RegExp` (optional)

The pattern matches the text between the mention triggering char and the cursor. In this case, it shall matches `$ To`
By default, this pattern will consider `{$` and `@` as mention triggering char.

- `afterMatchRegex: RegexExp` (optional)

The pattern matches the text between the cursor and mention ending char in text context. If no match is found, it will use
the editing text ending in the cursor position to match the mention.

By default, this pattern will match `}`

- `getText: string => string` (optional)

Triming the mention triggering and ending chars to compare the editing text with mention texts.

By default, the getText will remove all chars not in alpha-beta and numbers in the double ends.

- `MentionItemChild: React.Component<{mention: Mention, text: string}>` (optional)

Render the mention items with a customized component. The props is a object containing two properties:

- `mention: {name: string}` The mention object of `mentions : Array<Mention>` passed to plugin.
- `text: string` the editing text captured by `beforeMatchRegex` and `afterMatchRegex`. Used for highlighting
  the matched text in mention items for example.

By default, it is only `<span>{mention.name}</span>`

## Styling

### Containers

To style the container, you can specify the CSS for `ul.RichEditor-mention-menu`. To style the single mention item,
you can specify CSS for `ul.RichEditor-mention-menu > li` or customize `MentionItemChild` in creating the plugin.

### Padding

By the relative position between selection and mention pop-up, the mention container `ul.RichEditor-mention-menu`
is decorated by classes
`RichEditor-mention-position-top`, `RichEditor-mention-position-bottom`, `RichEditor-mention-position-left` and
`RichEditor-mention-position-right` respectively. If you always wants a `10px * 10 px` distance between selection
and mention pop up, you can

```css
.RichEditor-mention-position-top {
  margin-top: 10px;
}

.RichEditor-mention-position-bottom {
  margin-top: -10px;
}

.RichEditor-mention-position-left {
  margin-left: 10px;
}

.RichEditor-mention-position-right {
  margin-right: -10px;
}
```

## Why poor in package name?

Because all sensible names are taken in npm. :lol
